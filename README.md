# TLX Server Files

Welcome to the TLX Server Files. Long awaited. All I ask is that you follow the [license](https://github.com/LexTheGreat/TLX-Server-Files/blob/master/LICENSE). 

There is no support or updates for this repo.

This Addon requires [Debug Console](http://killzonekid.com/arma-console-extension-debug_console-dll-v3-0/) and the basic files needed for IniDB (Google it).

This version of the files is the lastest, other than the updated version with SQL saving that wont be released.

Have fun in Takistan!
